# GetIP

## How this code was created
This codebase was generated using prompt engineering techniques with the help of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant based on OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The project structure, code, and documentation were iteratively built by providing natural language prompts and refining the output generated by the model.
